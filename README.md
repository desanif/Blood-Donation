# Blood-Donation

This is a project developed for my course Mobile Application Development. 

#GIVEBLOOD #SAVELIVES

The main purpose of this application is to allows users to see nearby places where they can donate blood.

Pros:
Find near-by blood drive
Get Directions to blood bank
Click/Choose images for your donation
Share your images on social media
Setup your profile
Find out how easily how can you donate blood to and from whom can you receive (P.S. Always consult an expert doctor first)

Cons:
I wanted to use AWS Cognito for user login and sign-up, but after great ordeal of search, I found out that, to implement AWS Cognito
in Swift one needs a lot of moving parts to work together. Due to time constraint I was not able to acheive it. Hence, there are no 
user authentication mechanism in place.

Being not affiliated to any organization, its diffuclt to get real time data of blood organizations going on nearby. Rather this application
searches, established blood banks where can go and easily donate blood.

I welcome all to have a look at it and make changes if necessary.
